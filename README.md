- 🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blockchain and AI projects—especially those that brings the most value to people.

- 🌱 I’m learning how to live life and exploring a bit of everything in technology.

- 💬 Feel free to ask me anything! Worst case, I won’t have the answer.

- 📫 You can reach me at [@0xjoaonuno](https://x.com/0xjoaonuno) on X.

- 🌊 Fun fact: I’ve been a drummer since I was 9 years old. Surfer since a few months ago. Born doing bicep curls. Yep, that's it.
